This crate uses code forked from [Topiary](https://github.com/tweag/topiary), released under the MIT license.
The current version of that crate doesn't allow for the configuration that this project needs, so instead of listing it as a dependency we have copied and edited the code.
Note that we have trimmed down the dependencies to only use what we actually need.
